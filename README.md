# EPEX day-ahead price prediction for Germany

This is a simple statistical model to predict EPEX day-ahead prices for Germany based on various parameters.
It works to a reasonably good degree. Better than many of the commercial solutions.
This repository includes
- The self-training prediction model itself
- A simple Flask app to get a REST API up
- A Dockerfile to easily have it running wherever with gunicorn


## Lookout
- Maybe package it directly as a Home Assistant Add-on

## The Model
We sample a few sample points all over Germany and fetch hourly weather data for those for the past n days (default n=60).
This serves as the main data source.

Parameters:

- Wind sum
- Temperature average
- Expected solar output (computed via OpenMeteoSolarForecast)
- Hour of day
- Whether it is a Holiday/Sunday
- Whether it is a Saturday

Output:
- Electricity price

## How it works
- First, we create a simple multi-linear-regression to get an idea how important each of
the training parameters is.
- This alone is not enough, because electricity prices are not linear.
E.g. low wind&solar leads to gas power plants being turned on, and due to merit order pricing, electricity prices explode.
- Therefore, we then multiply each parameter with its weight (LinReg factor) to get a "normalized" data set.
- In the next step, we use a KNN (k=3) approach to find hours in the past with similar properties and use that to determine the final price.

## Model performance
No scientific evaluation. I just looked at the result and they mostly seem to be within 1-10%.
Some observations:
- At night, predictions are usually within 1-2ct/kWh
- Morning/Evening peaks are usually within 3-4ct/kWh
- Extreme peaks due to "Dunkelflaute" are correctly detected, but estimation of the exact price is high. E.g.
the model might predict 75ct, while in reality it's only 60ct or vice versa
- High PV noons are usually correctly detected. Sometimes it will return 3ct instead of -1ct, but the ballpark is usually correct.


# Public API
You can find a freely accessible installment of this software [here](https://epexpredictor.batzill.com/).
Get a glimpse of the current prediction [here](https://epexpredictor.batzill.com/prices).

There are no guarantees given whatsoever - it might work for you or not.
I might stop or block this service at any time. Fair use is expected!

# Home Assistant integration
At some point, I might create a HA addon to run everything locally.
For now, you have to either use my server, or run it yourself.
